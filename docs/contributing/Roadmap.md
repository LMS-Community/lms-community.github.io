# The Future
At its core, LMS is a mature, top-tier,  audio streaming server with thousands of happy users.  It has an underlying architecture that has proved to be extensible and adaptable to new technology and new ways of accessing music.  The very active and resourceful LMS community has and will continue to take advantage of this architecture to keep LMS up-to-date with the latest streaming services and technologies.

Inevitably, due to LMS's longevity, there are areas where change and improvement is required to keep pace with user expectations, changing user behaviours and new integrating technologies.
Additionally, the gradual move to a wholly community run project means that new ways of organising and collaborating are required to keep LMS moving forward.

To facilitate managing this we have, firstly,  defined a broad set of  "Goals" that describe the direction and what in what way, we want LMS to change.  Secondly, we have defined a much more detailed **Roadmap**, which defines a high level plan of the set of changes we plan to make.   This **Roadmap** is informed by the set of goals. Everything in the **Roadmap** moves forward one or more of the community's **Goals**.

## Future Goals and aspirations

Here are the set of goals, each one is a broad definition of how we would like LMS to change:

| | GOAL|
|:-:|:-|
|**1.**|LMS has a consistent visual theme and user experience in all of LMS user interfaces, on all platforms.|
|**2.**|LMS has an install process and guided first-time user experience that guides a new user through all the popular usage scenarios, recommended community provided features, and music service integration options.|
|**3.**|LMS has an out-of-the-box controller web application accessible from mobile devices.|
|**4.**|LMS has a secure and flexible 3rd party plugin/app store facility to provide low friction user access to community provided features.|
|**5.**|LMS has an integrated secure user/partner secret and key storage capability to increase 3rd party service integration options.|
