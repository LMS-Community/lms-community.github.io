Jivelite is a cut down version of the [SqueezePlay](squeezeplay.md) application based on the BSD licensed Logitech code. To simplify the code-base all audio playback capabilities and many of the applets included were removed from SqueezePlay. Together with [Squeezelite](squeezelite.md) this creates a modern and capable display and playback solution, as the audio capabilities of Squeezelite have been enhanced over the years compared to the audio capabilities of SqueezePlay. Also, Jivelite has more graphics capabilities (multiple skins for resolutions ranging from 640x480 to 1920x1080).

Jivelite is originally developed by Adrian Smith and now maintained by :octicons-mark-github-16: [Ralph Irving](https://github.com/ralph-irving/jivelite).

## Downloads

Jivelite runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Builds for these platforms can be found on :simple-sourceforge: [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lmsclients/files/jivelite/). Instructions to install can be found in the builds repository.

If you are running [piCorePlayer](picoreplayer.md), Jivelite is very easy to install! Jivelite can be installed on piCorePlayer via the \[Tweaks\] page on the piCorePlayer web interface. piCorePlayer fully supports Jivelite on the Raspberry Pi’s official 7" touch display (among other screens).
