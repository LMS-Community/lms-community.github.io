The Squeezebox (also known as Squeezebox 1, abbreviated SB1), released in 2003, is the second generation network media player, produced by Slim Devices. It plays MP3, WMA, AAC, FLAC, WAV, OggVorbis, Shoutcast (and more using [Plugins](../plugins/index.md)), which are streamed over a network from Slim Devices' custom software, Lyrion Music Server, just like the SLIMP3, but this version included 802.11b wireless as an option. However, this model is only capable of WEP encryption, making its addition to newer wireless networks with WPA or other encryption impossible. The Squeezebox2 does not have this limitation.
