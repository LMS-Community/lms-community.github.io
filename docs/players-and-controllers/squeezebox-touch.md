The Squeezebox Touch, released in April 2010, is the most recent product in the Squeezebox product line. It can be controlled via an IR remote, the touch screen, or by any other controller interface, like the Lyrion Music Server Web UI or the Squeezebox Controller.

It also has the capacity to run as a server, which means that you can connect an USB hard drive with music to the Squeezebox Touch, and do without a dedicated computer or NAS to run Squeezebox Server.

The Squeezebox Touch has a 24-bit, 96 kHz capable DAC.
