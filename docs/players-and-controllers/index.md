## Hardware
Although Slim Devices and Logitech players are no longer produced, there is a huge selection of hardware players that are available and compatible with LMS.  In fact, many users have moved on to do it yourself (DIY) hardware.  The DIY choices range from simple and free (install software on your computer or phone) to complex and expensive (reclockers with femtosecond accuracy, ultracapacitors, etc.)

### Legacy Hardware
Between 2001 and 2010 Logitech (and its predecessor Slim Devices) released [a series of network music players](hardware-comparison.md).  This hardware is still widely used (and treasured!) and used units can be found to purchase online. 
 
### DIY hardware offerings
