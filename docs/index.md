Lyrion Music Server (formerly Logitech Media Server) is open-source server software that powers a wide range of audio players. With the help of many plugins, Lyrion can stream your local music collection, internet radio stations, and content from many music services.

## LMS Ecosystem

Although Squeezeboxes started in 2000 with hardware and software developed by Slim Devices, which was later acquired by  Logitech, nowadays a wide array of hardware and software solutions make up the LMS ecosystem.

To get a functioning LMS system you need to have three components, namely (1) a server, (2) a controller and (3) one or more music players. These three components can be supplied by a single device such as a Raspberry Pi with a touchscreen running piCorePlayer.  But because of its scalability, all of these services can be distributed across separate devices to support libraries of hundreds of thousands of tracks and numerous players distributing music throughout an entire house and even across multiple locations.

With Lyrion, you have greater control and customization of your music - how the server works, how you interact with it, and what it looks like.  You have the ability to use the same interface to access your music on almost any device, and to select the appropriate player for every need. There is wide support by the LMS community to add new functionality, fix issues, and help support users to get the most enjoyment from their music.
