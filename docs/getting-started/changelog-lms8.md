- [Upstream fixes from Logitech Media Server 8.1.x](#version-812)

- New Features:

	- Try to group online artists with local artists by ignoring slightly different spelling (eg. "The Beatles" vs. "Beatles", "Amy Macdonald" vs. "Amy MacDonald").
	- [#510](https://github.com/LMS-Community/slimserver/issues/510) \- Add (optional) "balanced" track shuffling method, which is less random, but hopefully more pleasing to the listener.
	- [#537](https://github.com/LMS-Community/slimserver/pull/537) \- Add audio option to combine channels to build a mono signal (whether player is synchronized or not).
	- [#538](https://github.com/LMS-Community/slimserver/pull/538) \- Add Balance setting for players which support it (thanks philippe44!).

- Server Changes:

	- When an online scan doesn't return any track, but previously had some, do not remove tracks from library. The empty new list is likely due to a scan failure.
	- Try to improve backwards compatibility with eg. Erland's plugins, which sometimes struggle with the remote tracks.
	- [#411](https://github.com/LMS-Community/slimserver/issues/411) \- Transcoder conversion rules: Support resampling for Ogg/Flac streams (thanks bpa/mw9!)
	- [#598](https://github.com/LMS-Community/slimserver/pull/598) \- Shuffle tracks added with "playlist loadtracks" and certain search filters (thanks philchillbill!)

	- Remove Font::FreeType from Linux distributions. It's easy enough to install it using the system's package manager, and it would conflict on system where we don't provide the binary.

- Bug Fixes:

	- [#554](https://github.com/LMS-Community/slimserver/issues/554) \- Long current playlist disappears from UI during wipe and rescan.
	- [#601](https://github.com/LMS-Community/slimserver/issues/601) \- "icon" for URL="file://..." entries does not work in favorites.ompl.

	- [#528](https://github.com/LMS-Community/slimserver/issues/528) \- On Unix-like platforms, we now ensure that plugins are installed in such a way that none of their files are writable by users other than the user running LMS, even if theyʼre stored that way in the plugin ZIP file.
	- No longer include the firmware images for ip3k based players (Classic, Boom, Receiver, Transporter) with the installation packages. Logitech Media Server can download them when needed. But after about a decade without updates it's unlikely anybody would still have to update anyway.

## Version 8.1.2

- Server Changes:

	- [#522](https://github.com/LMS-Community/slimserver/pull/522) \- add new --advertiseaddr startup parameter to tell LMS what user facing IP address to use (in case of NATed setups, like with load balancers or Kubernetes etc.) - thanks fuero!
