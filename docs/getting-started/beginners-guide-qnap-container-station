!!! note two
    This installation was tested on a QNAP TS-453mini


## Assumptions

In this guide the following assumptions apply:

- Your music is stored in seperate share. The screenshots use `/media/audio/music`
- Playlists are stored in `/media/playlists 
- The configuration is kept in `/ContainerConfigs/lmsconf
- To sync the timezone between QNAP NAS a symlink is needed. This requires SSH access. But this is not strictly needed it can be skipped.
- You have nothing else running at port 9000 on your NAS.

## Preperations
Create a new folder (with _File Station_) under `ContainerCOnfigs` called `lmsconf`

## Preperation [Optional] 
In order to sync the timezone with the NAS access to /etc/TZ is needed. This folder is not accessible by containers so create a symlink in a location that is.
1. Logon to your NAS with a user that has the proper rights and enter
```sh
ln -s /etc/TZ /share/ContainerConfigs/timezone
```
We will use this symlink to map the containers `/etc/timzone` to make both media server and NAS in the same timezone.

## Add the published image to Container station
1. Open Container station
2. Under _Containers_ click _+ Create_
3. Use image 'lmscommunity/logitechmediaserver` and click next
4. Disable the _Default web URL port
5. Click _Advaced settings_ at the lower left
6. By networks select Custom and Host
7. Under storage delete the locations of `/config`, `/music`, and `/playlist`
8. [Optional] Select Bind Mount Host Path, navigate to `Container\timezone`, at Container enter `\etc\timezone` and make it RO
9. Select _Bind Mount Host Path_, at Host select the location of your music files at Container type `/music`
10. Repeat the same steps for your playlist connect to `\playlist`
11. Repeat for `/ContainerConfigs` and `/config/`

In the end it might look something like
