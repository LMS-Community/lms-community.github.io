Dear Squeezebox/Logitech Media Server/Lyrion Music Server user

You are a subscribed member of the LMS community (forums.slimdevices.com). This forum was provided by Logitech as a courtesy to its existing customers for many years after the end of Squeezebox development. We are very grateful for that!

But as you might know Logitech has ended all Squeezebox related activity about a year ago. As a consequence the community has found a new home under the Lyrion.org umbrella. We want to keep this community alive. And in order to achieve this we plan to migrate all of forums.slimdevices.com to forums.lyrion.org. This includes your existing accounts and postings etc.

If you’re no longer interested in all things Squeezebox and Lyrion Music Server (previously also known as Logitech Media Server, Squeezebox Server), may I kindly ask you to delete your account before January 13th 2025? Sign in to your account on [https://forums.slimdevices.com](https://forums.slimdevices.com), head to User Settings -> Privacy, and follow the Delete Account flow. Thanks in advance!

If you decide to stay around - excellent! The biggest change will be that the forum URL has to change. We can no longer use the Logitech owned slimdevices.com domain. But other than that you’ll instantly feel at home, as we will work hard to make the transition completely transparent.

Please note that during the migration process, which is scheduled for mid January, there can be some downtime during which neither forum will be accessible. But worry not: we’ll be back.

Thank you very much for your interest in Squeezebox and Lyrion.org.

Cheers,

Michael
