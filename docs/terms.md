## 1. Your Rights and Choices

(a) By law, you have certain rights that cannot be limited by a contract. These Terms are in no way intended to limit those rights.

You warrant that you have the legal power and authority to enter into these Terms.

For the avoidance of doubt, this also applies to promotional materials, legal documents, and any other Intellectual Property Rights. The use, reproduction, and distribution of Open-Source Software is subject to the terms of the applicable Public License.

(d) Our [Privacy Policy](privacy.md) explains what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we may share it. <!-- View our GDPR Compliance Statement (link) to learn more about the rights you have as a resident of the European Economic Area ("EEA") and our ongoing commitment to user privacy and the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR").

## 5. Feedback, Contributions and Future Functionality

(a) Feedback. We welcome suggestions, enhancement requests or other feedback (collectively, "Feedback") from our users, customers, partners and the developer community. You may, in your sole discretion, provide Feedback relating to the Software, Services or Documentation.

(b) Use of Feedback. We may use your Feedback for any purpose without notice, restriction or compensation of any kind. You hereby grant Lyrion a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate any Feedback relating to the Software, Services or Documentation that is provided by you or your contractors or Affiliates.

## 6. Documentation and Digital Assets

(a) [lyrion.org](index.md) maintained in public repositories is available under the terms of the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License. Other terms may apply to Digital Assets — in particular illustrations, graphics, and videos — embedded in the documentation if they are licensed to us solely for direct distribution. When in doubt, please ask before distributing or using them for other works.

(b) We hereby grant you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable right to use the Digital Assets in combination with the Software and Services, unless otherwise noted.

(c) Because some Digital Assets are licensed to us solely for direct distribution, we cannot redistribute them under a more permissive license for other purposes. If the author or copyright holder has not released them under a permissive license, you must obtain a license before using them in your own work, whether commercial or non-commercial in nature.


## 7. Trademark and Brand Assets

(a) Lyrion’s Brand Assets are proprietary assets owned exclusively by Lyrion. We reserve the right to object to any use or misuse in any jurisdiction worldwide.

(b) Contributors, licensees, business partners, and other third parties may never claim ownership of Lyrion's Brand Assets or brands confusingly similar to Lyrion's Brand Assets in any way, including, without limitation, as a trademark, service mark, company name or designation, domain name, social media profile/handle, or in any other manner.

(c) You may not include the Lyrion trademark in the name of your app, product, or service, whether commercial or non-commercial in nature. This includes online services such as e-commerce, community, blog, information, advertising, and personal home pages, as well as apps, app stores, client apps, or third-party apps that interact with Lyrion.

## 8. Hosting and Removal of Content

Self-hosting is the easiest way to stay in control and protect your [privacy](privacy.md). Data that never leaves your private network cannot be seen or used by anyone, not us or anyone else. This section ONLY APPLIES TO DATA THAT YOU INTENTIONALLY DISCLOSE in order to provide it to others, communicate with them, or make it available with your consent, for example to test our software. To avoid misunderstandings, please read these terms carefully.

(a) Property and Privacy Rights. Your content remains your property, which means that you retain all intellectual property rights in your content. You are responsible for your use of our Services and for all content you provide, share, sync, or upload, including compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. You are only permitted to share another person's content if they have given you their permission. Please respect the rights and privacy of others as we respect them.

(b) Content Uploads. If you upload your content to any of our Services, such as our github repository, which is accessible to anyone without a password, or to a hosted Service that you have requested to prevent others from accessing your self-hosted server at home, you grant us (1) a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use (for example, host, display, or convert) your content for technical purposes, (2) to make your content publicly available if and to the extent you have made it visible to others, (3) sublicense these rights to other users to enable the Services to function as intended, for example to enable you to share the content as intended including tests of our software. This license will continue for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights, unless you remove your content from our Services before.

(c) Content Removal. If you remove your content from our Services, our systems will no longer make that content publicly available within a reasonable time unless you have already shared copies of your content with others before you removed it. If your content was publicly available, it is possible that search engines such as Google will continue to find your content and display it as part of their search results.

(d) Unlawful Content. We reserve the right to remove content that violates these Terms, such as copyright or trademark infringement or other forms of intellectual property appropriation, impersonation, unlawful conduct, or harassment.

## 9. Account and Communications

(a) Account. You may need to create an account to use some of our services. You are responsible for safeguarding your account. Please use a strong password and limit its use to this account. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.

(b) Communications. You can control most of the communications you receive from us. If you have signed up to receive newsletters and/or general product notifications, you can unsubscribe at any time. To do so, click on the "unsubscribe" or "opt-out" link in the emails you receive. Even if you opt out, we may continue to contact you if there are problems with your user account, such as failed transactions, and to provide the services you have requested, help you resolve problems, answer questions, comply with applicable laws and regulations, and for similar purposes as described in our [Privacy Policy](privacy.md).

## 10. Payments, Subscriptions and Memberships

(a) All amounts payable are non-refundable. The payment process is handled by third parties. There may be fees applied, which are not the responsibility of Lyrion.

## 11. Proprietary Information

(a) The term "Proprietary Information" shall mean any trade secret or confidential or proprietary information designated as such in writing by the Disclosing Party, whether by letter or by the use of an appropriate proprietary stamp or legend, prior to or at the time such trade secret or confidential or proprietary information is disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Recipient.

(b) The Recipient and its Representatives shall use the Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party only for the purpose of negotiating, concluding, and conducting business transactions (together, the "Purposes") and such Proprietary Information shall not be used for any other purpose without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, which may be given or withheld by the Disclosing Party in its sole and absolute discretion. The Recipient and its Representatives shall hold in confidence, and shall not disclose, any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party; provided, however, that (i) the Recipient may make any disclosure of such information to which the Disclosing Party gives its prior written consent; and (ii) any of the Proprietary Information may be disclosed by the Recipient to its Representatives or prospective investors, lenders or acquirors as part of their due diligence investigations who need to know such information in connection with the Purposes and who are bound by confidentiality obligations with respect to that Proprietary Information that are substantially similar to those set forth in these Terms. In any event, the Recipient agrees, at its sole expense, to use its best efforts to restrain its Representatives from prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or use of the Proprietary Information.

(c) In the event that the Recipient becomes legally compelled (such as by order of court, administrative agency, or other governmental body) to disclose any portion of the Disclosing Party’s Proprietary Information, only that portion of the Disclosing Party’s Proprietary Information that is legally required to be disclosed shall be disclosed.

(d) The Recipient shall, upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, return to the Disclosing Party all Proprietary Information received by the Recipient or its Representatives from the Disclosing Party (and all copies and reproductions thereof). In addition, the Recipient shall destroy any notes, reports, or other documents prepared by the Recipient which contain Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party.

(e) As between the Parties, Lyrion will retain all ownership rights in and to its Software, Services, Documentation, and all derivative works thereof, however made, and all Intellectual Property Rights incorporated into or related to the foregoing. All rights not expressly licensed to Customer by Lyrion under a License Agreement or provided under a Public License are reserved. Customer hereby grants to Lyrion a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicenseable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate any suggestions, enhancement requests, or other feedback related to the Software, Services, or Documentation that is provided by Customer or its contractors or Affiliates.

## 12. Final Provisions

(a) Waiver. In the event that you breach these Terms and we do not take any action, we will still be entitled to use our rights and remedies in any other situation where you breach these Terms.

(b) Applicable Law and Jurisdiction. These Terms and any action related thereto shall be governed by the laws of Switzerland to the exclusion of IPR (International Law) and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). All claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with our Software, Services, or Documentation will be brought solely in the courts located in Aarau (Switzerland), and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.

If you are a consumer, we agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Aarau (Switzerland), which means that you may bring an action to enforce your consumer protection rights in connection with these Terms in Switzerland or in the EU country in which you live. The European Commission provides an online dispute resolution platform that you can access at https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. We prefer to resolve any issues in direct contact with you and therefore do not participate in alternative consumer dispute resolution procedures. If you wish to bring a matter to our attention, please [contact us](contact.md).

If you are a federal, state, or local government agency in the United States using our Software, Services, or Documentation in your official capacity and are legally unable to accept the above applicable law, jurisdiction or venue clauses, then these clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal entities, these Terms and all related actions will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted by federal law, the laws of the State of Delaware (excluding choice of law).

(c) Severability Clause. If a provision of these Terms is or becomes legally invalid or if there is any gap that needs to be filled, the validity of the remainder of these Terms shall not be affected thereby. Invalid provisions shall be replaced by common consent with such provisions which come as close as possible to the intended result of the invalid provision. In the event of gaps, such provisions shall come into force by common consent which comes as close as possible to the intended result of these Terms, should the matter have been considered in advance.

(d) Changes Must Be in Writing. Any changes of or amendments to these Terms must be in writing to become effective.
