# Introduction

The Lyrion Music Server provides a command-line interface to the players via TCP/IP. After starting the server, commands and queries may be sent by connecting to a specific TCP/IP port. The server will reply echoing the request (for commands) or by returning the requested data (for queries). By default, the server will listen for connections on TCP/IP port 9090. This format is designed for ease of integration into AMX, Crestron and other automation systems.

See [Using the command-line interface](using-the-cli.md) for details.


## Supported Commands

The available commands and queries are listed below, grouped by their scope:

* [General](general.md): general management of the Command Line Interface and of the server.
* [Players](players.md): management of players.
* [Database](database.md): mangement of the music database.
* [Playlist](playlist.md): management of the playlist of each player.
* [Compound Queries](compoundqueries.md): queries to get most of the information about the server or a player in one convenient query, that can be updated by the server automatically.
* [Notifications](notifications.md): internal server commands echoed to the CLI by using the "listen" or "subscribe" commands.
* [Alarms](alarms.md): management of alarms.

## Changelog

### Migration of the CLI documentation (April 2024)

* The CLI documentation was previously included as part of the embedded help in the LMS server distribution, accessible as a single (big) HTML page on a url like `LMS-SERVER:LMS-PORT/html/docs/cli-api.html`.
* The documentation here is based on `cli-api.html` from LMS Server v8.5. It is essentially unchanged, beyond dividing it into separate pages, formatting, plus a few corrections.
* Original sections "Deprecated", and "Plugins" have not been migrated.
* Future LMS server distributions (from v9 onwards) will no longer have the CLI documentation in the embedded help.
