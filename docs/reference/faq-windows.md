# FAQ: Lyrion Music Server on Windows

## After installation I'm told Lyrion Music Server wasn't started. What can I do?


## Can I have more than one music folder?

## How can I connect to my music on a NAS?


## I can't connect to my NAS using my Microsoft Account. What's wrong with it?

## Where's the tray icon to start/stop Lyrion Music Server?

The tool to build the old tray icon is no longer available. Starting with Logitech Music Server 9.0 we can no longer provide that tool.

But you might be interested in this [Service Tray](https://www.coretechnologies.com/products/ServiceTray/) utility. It can be configured to start/stop the LMS service and the icon in the system tray has colors so you can see the status of your service that you configured it for. And it's free to use.
