A wide array of hardware and software solutions make up the LMS ecosystem of servers and players for many different operating systems, and these have changed many times over the years.</p> <p>For a LMS system, there will need to be server software running on a controlling computer or device. This provides connections, settings, and customizations to one or more music players. The peer user community is committed to developing the Lyrion software for a wide variety of common and easily obtained devices such as a Windows or Mac computer, tablets and phones, and Raspberry Pi. Because of its scalability, all of these services can be distributed across separate devices to support libraries of hundreds of thousands of tracks and numerous players distributing music throughout an entire house and even across multiple locations.</p> <p>With Lyrion, you have greater control and customization of your music - how the server works, how you interact with it, and what it looks like.  You have the ability to use the same interface to access your music on almost any device, and to select the appropriate player for every need. There is wide support by the LMS community to add new functionality, fix issues, integrate with other products, and help support users to get the most enjoyment from their music.</p> <p>If you're new to Lyrion, click on Getting Started with LMS to learn more.</p>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact Information","text":""},{"location":"contact/#support","title":"Support","text":"<p>We don't provide formal support.

You can view the raw tag names through LMS by browsing to the track via the album and then going to More/More Info/View Tags (after importing to LMS, of course).

The first group learned to accept or even actually liked that updates to tags would cause an album to move back to the top of the list.  The second group were more New Music purists who would carefully manage their file modified dates by using tagging software that supported an option for preserving file modified dates. But as a result, this meant that a \"Clear Library and Rescan All\" would have to be run after each change to tags and required careful manual management of backing up those changes too.

It's base on the experience made with eg. Spotty or Qobuz. Check out one of those plugins if you want to get more ideas.</p>"},{"location":"reference/music-service-plugin/#filemodule-organization","title":"File/Module Organization","text":"<p>Here's a rough layout of a typical folder and file structure for a plugin:</p> <ul> <li><code>Plugins/MyMusicService</code><ul> <li><code>Plugin.pm</code>: this is the entry point to the plugin. It deals with setting up all dependencies and gives shared code a home. It initializes the settings, importer, protocol handler etc.</li> <li><code>API.pm</code>: this module implements the API interaction with the music service. In many cases we want to further split it up (see below) for async (server) and sync (scanner/importer) modes. In this case I put shared code in <code>API.pm</code>, eg. URLs, data manipulation routines etc. I usually provide one method per API call.<ul> <li><code>API/Async.pm</code>: these API call implementations use LMS' own <code>Slim::Networking::SimpleAsyncHTTP</code> class to run non-blocking requests. This is crucial to not interrupt playback, as LMS is single threaded.</li> <li><code>API/Sync.pm</code>: in order to run synchronous API calls you can use <code>LWP::UserAgent</code>. This is important for eg. the importer code, as the scanner doesn't provide the aforementioned support for async calls.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>OPML.pm</code> (or <code>Browse.pm</code>): the <code>OPML</code> name is a bit outdated. What I put in there is the code which provides the browse modes, the navigation tree. All API calls done within this module must use async HTTP requests to not block the server. I try to separate out navigation tree nodes into their own subs. Typically such a sub would call the API to get back the raw data, then transform this data into navigation elements.</li> <li><code>ProtocolHandler.pm</code>: the protocol handler class deals with much of the playback (and deserves its own document...). LMS uses pseudo protocols like <code>spotty://</code> or <code>qobuz://</code> to deal with tracks and other aspects of these services.</li> <li><code>Settings.pm</code>: handle configuration tasks for the plugin. Sometimes there's more to it, eg. if special pages or handlers are required for authentication etc. In this case we can have additional modules in the <code>Settings</code> namespace.<ul> <li><code>Settings/Auth.pm</code>: another handler to deal with authentication</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>Importer.pm</code>: this module is used when a music service can be imported into the \"My Music\" collection. It would be called to import favorite artists, albums, etc. from the music service. All API calls done from the importer must use synchronous HTTP requests!<ul> <li><code>startScan()</code>: this is the entry point called from the scanner code. Everything called from here must not use any of the async stuff usually used in the server.</li> <li><code>needsUpdate()</code>: this method tells the Online Music Library Integration plugin whether any change in a user's music service account requires a rescan of the library. This method must use async calls, as it's run in the server. It should be a relatively cheap call or series of calls to get a fingerprint of the user's library with the service. If the fingerprint changes, OMLI should re-run a scan. Some services would have such a fingerprint or \"last changed\" timestamp in the user's profile. On others it can be helpful to see how many itemst there are (albums, playlists, artists), and/or the latest change to any of them happened etc. This avoids pulling in all the library just to figure out whether a rescan was even required.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>HTML/EN/plugins/MyMusicService</code>: this folder provides the home for HTML templates, static content like stylesheets, JavaScript etc.<ul> <li><code>html</code>: this additional subfolder is the home of static content. It can be accessed without an additional page handler. Images belong here.</li> <li><code>settings</code>: if there's a need for more than the basic settings page I often put the templates in their own subfolder. That's absolutely optional.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>Bin/*</code>: provide a home for platform specific binaries, if needed.</li> <li><code>lib</code>: put your additional CPAN modules in there.</li> <li><code>install.xml</code>: the plugin's manifest file.</li> <li><code>strings.txt</code>: a simple text file with string translations. See Adding Translations for details about the format.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"reference/music-service-plugin/#important-notes","title":"Important Notes","text":"<ul> <li>Be kind to the music service. Try to avoid unnecessary requests by using caching etc. You don't want to run into request rate limitations.</li> <li>Don't cache too aggressively: users know when they changed something on the service.

This allows you to optimize your code along the way, before you've got too much code.</li> <li>Try to support multiple accounts. Your users sooner or later will ask for them.

The server can order this read pointer to be reset to the beginning of the buffer by sending a control code of \"3\" to the client in a data packet. These control codes also control whether the decoder is running or not (see 'm' write MPEG data).</p> <p>At the start of each track, the server will send a number of packets with the control set to \"3\", in order to allow the client to build up a small buffer before starting decoding.

The SLIMP3 maintains two pointers, called rptr and wptr, which track the position at which the DMA controller is reading (out to the decoder) and writing (in from the network). When a new stream is started, the SLIMP3 begins by initializing an empty buffer, with rptr == wptr == 0. It then begins requesting data from the server, starting from 0. The server replies with some data, which the SLIMP3 writes into the buffer. Once the buffer reaches 50% capacity, the decoder is started, and the rptr begins to increment. The SLIMP3 continues requesting data until the buffer is 90% full. Once the buffer reaches this \"almost full\" state, the SLIMP3 continually checks buffer usage, requesting more data only when the buffer usage drops below the \"almost full\" level.</p> <p>Timeouts due to a lost packet are handled by the client.
